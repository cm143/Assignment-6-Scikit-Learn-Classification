I used datasets.load_breast_cancer() to load the breast cancer data, .data and .target to get the data and labels from the data, model_selection.train_test_split to split the data into testing and sample data, .fit to train the data, .predict to predict the class, .accuracy score to get the accuracy score of the data, .confusion_matrix to create a confusion matrix of the data, .multilabel_confusion_matrix to create a multilabel confusion matrix of the data, .f1_score to get the f1 score of the data, .precision_score to get the precision score of the data, and .recall_score to get the precision score of the data. I did not add any limitations to the code.
